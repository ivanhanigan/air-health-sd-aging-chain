# air-health-sd-aging-chain
System dynamics model for estimating premature mortalities attributable to PM2.5 air pollution exposure. Uses aging chain stock-flow framework to track population cohorts over time under different emissions scenarios. Calculates disease burden from baseline and counterfactual exposure levels to quantify health impacts of air quality changes.
